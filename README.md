# The purpose of this code is to create a work event schedule that highlights due and over due assigments to keep better track of the work schedule

# The time appears on the calendar at the top, past time is higlighted in gray, present in red, and future in green to allow for calendar to be easily read

## When a change to the calendar is made, the save button allows changes to be saved

# Local storage holds the changes and when the page is refreshed, the changes do not go away
